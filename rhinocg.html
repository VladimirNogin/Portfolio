   <h3 class="heading">Project overview</h3>
   <p class="text">Rhino Camera Gear is a camera equipment manufacturer whose primary source of revenue was through online channels. It was my responsibility to identify user frustrations, provide solutions to both business and user problems and drive online sales up through strategic and delightful design.<br><br>I approached this task at hand by first taking a inventory of the current website and then conducting usability studies while also engaging the community with surveys for feedback ranging from the current website to where they want to see the company go in the future. Below are some shots of the work done, hope you enjoy!</p>
   <h3 class="heading">Understanding the problem</h3>
   <p class="text">After conducting a thorough review of the old website website I noticed major problems that were affecting online sales and the browsing experience. Two big problems I moved forward with was to fix the navigation by introducing standard UX patterns and better functionality, the other problem was fixing dead ends and non responsive pages that were affecting mobile users.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Usability testing</h3>
   <p class="text">Started off by initiating usability studies of the current site, I observed 10 users try and complete given tasks on our website. I noticed their frustrations and confusion, I came back with answers and actionable I could take right away.<br><br>Addition to observing users I put together surveys to get a deeper understanding of the problems and hear from previous customers. Being the only designer on the team I conducted as many different usability studies as possible to better my design decisions.</p>
   <h3 class="heading">Customer journey map</h3>
   <p class="text">I mapped out the user's current journey and all the touch points that they have along the process based on the conducted usability studies and surveys. This was a great way to visually display problems and with a team and focus in on actionable we could take to fix them. Addition to creating a current journey map I also created a journey map of what the customer's journey should look like for comparison.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Outcome</h3>
   <p class="text">The website saw an increase in conversion, the navigation was made consistent across the whole site and there was now a sense of direction and location no matter where the user dropped in. I implemented a gallery page for all the products, modules and accessories where we could educate users how our products synced with one another and how they work. Most importantly I simplified the product and bundle line-up by removing complicating product names and rearranging them in a understandable and clean hierarchy with a neat feature to customize your bundle with what suits your needs.</p>
