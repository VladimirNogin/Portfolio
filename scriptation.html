   <h3 class="heading">Overview</h3>
   <p class="text">Scriptation is a unique PDF text editor that is aimed at the Hollywood movie industry. Scriptation was a big hit on the iOS platform and had received praise from Apple for their innovation. Scriptation decided to bring their product to the Windows platform and ecosystem.<br>I was asked to provide design guidance for about a day but ended up designing massive files for their development team and working closely with the product owner on creating a delightful user experience by taking advantage of the technology Microsoft has to offer. Below are polished designs and a small glimpse into my product design process.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Applying Fluent Design</h3>
   <p class="text">After having laid down a solid UX structure in the wireframing phase I then started to apply visual design. Scriptation being one of the very first few apps that adopted fluent design so early I was entering unknown grounds. Implementing a new design language was challenging, thrilling, motivating, rewarding and extremely insightful.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Input devices</h3>
   <p class="text">Windows supports many input methods that are extremely powerful when tailored to the right experience. In addition to surface pen inking I designed a user interface for the surface dial to accommodate the pen and ultimately boost user task efficiency. As simple as the dial might look the UX behind it is more complex than some may think.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Onboarding Motion</h3>
   <p class="text">Motion can be a powerful element that can guide a user through the app experience. I experimented with motion to see how best this element can enhance the learnability of the app.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Wireframing</h3>
   <p class="text">I spent time prototyping my wireframes and sharing them out with stakeholder in order for everyone to get a clear picture of the product we are building and where we can improve the user experience. At this phase getting the UX right was extremely important.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Prototyping wireframes using Adobe XD</h3>
   <p class="text">Adobe XD is a fantastic tool for quick wireframing, designing interactions and visualizing product hierarchy. Below is one of many wireframe prototypes I shared early on in the product design cycle with stakeholders and the development team.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Redlines / Specs</h3>
   <p class="text">My design process didn’t just end with polished designs, I worked really hard to make sure my designs were implemented right and on time. I believe working close with developers is a must for any designer and understanding development limitations early on in the product design cycle will help you make better design decisions…also your developers won’t hate you :)</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Stakeholder feedback</h3>
   <p class="text_quotes">"Design in particular is going well. Coming from the iOS world it's been extremely helpful to have the design team guiding us to make the app look and feel like it belongs on Windows. Vlad is a standout. Not only has his work been superb but he has gone above and beyond in his design. His layouts are beautiful and his details are precise."</p>
   <p class="quote_reference">Steve Vitolo - Scriptation founder & CEO</p>
   <p class="text_quotes">"The project was a great success because of your talent and abilities! I want you to show off your achievements internally once we have the build. You did all the heavy lifting and deserve huge credit for Scriptation becoming a showcase Fluent design Windows app that outshines its iOS counterpart."</p>
