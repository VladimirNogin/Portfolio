      <h3 class="about_heading">Professional experience</h3>
      <p class="about_text">Hi, my name is Vlad and I'm a UI/UX Product Designer. As a product designer with over 4 years of experience I have crafted responsive & engaging user experiences across a wide range of digital platforms. Due to my strong passion for product, I am able to distill complex problems into simple and elegant experiences that take advantage of the specific capabilities of each platform, while also meeting business requirements. I understand the power of designer/developer collaboration and thrive in challenging environments that cultivate teamwork, learning and growth. Over my years of experience Iâ€™ve worked on products in construction, entertainment, fashion, media, B2B, health and productivity just to name a few.</p>

I was proudly one of the first few designers to get early access for Adove XD (Known as comet at that time). Below are some of my favorite tools I've come to like over the years, my knowledge of the listed tools blow ranges from advanced to expert.</p>
