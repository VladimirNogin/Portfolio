      <h3 class="about_heading">Professional experience</h3>
      <p class="about_text">Hi, my name is Vlad and I'm a UI/UX Product Designer. As a product designer with over 4 years of experience I have crafted responsive & engaging user experiences across a wide range of digital platforms. Due to my strong passion for product, I am able to distill complex problems into simple and elegant experiences that take advantage of the specific capabilities of each platform, while also meeting business requirements. I understand the power of designer/developer collaboration and thrive in challenging environments that cultivate teamwork, learning and growth. Over my years of experience I’ve worked on products in construction, entertainment, fashion, media, B2B, health and productivity just to name a few.</p>

    <h3 class="tools_heading">Design tools I've come to like</h3>
    <p class="tools_text">Having the right tools to enable my full potential is important, so i'm always one of the first few to jump on a new tool when it's available and see if the tool adds value to my design process. I was one of the first few designers to gain early access for Adobe XD (Known as Project Comet at that time) private beta. Below are some of my favorite tools I've come to like over the years, my knowledge of the listed tools blow ranges from advanced to expert.</p>

    <h3 class="tools_heading">My design proccess</h3>
    <p class="tools_text">I believe listening and asking the right questions early on in a product design cycle is important, matter of fact I think it's very important. I begin by sitting down with stakeholders and gathering as much product requirements as possible. I then dig deep into the market and users I would be designing for, I do this by talking to them and conducting usability studies like i've done for my past projects that I've displayed here. Aligning business requirements along with user/customer expectations will lead to a better and successful product in the end. All this is followed by wirefrmaing, prototyping, design and then a back and forth process with developers on brining my designs and ideas to life.</p>

    <h3 class="story_heading">What inspires me?</h3>
    <p class="story_text">When I’m not behind the screen designing awesome stuff you can find me outside enjoying nature, taking long walks or riding my motorcycle through many of Washington’s beautiful windy roads. I enjoy the small things in life, how can you enjoy the bigger things in life if you first don’t enjoy the small ones. I believe enjoyment and happiness is in the journey and not in the destination, that is why I’m grateful for everyday I get to see my friends at work and together create awesome products for others to enjoy. It's all the things around me that inspire me and my work. If you found any of this interesting then reach out to me and say hi and if you found it boring…well…reach out to me anyways! :)</p>
