   <h3 class="heading">Project overview</h3>
   <p class="text">Van Arsdel inventory is a UWP fluent app I helped design for Microsoft Build 2018 to showcase new controls and capabilities for the Microsoft enterprise market. This enterprise app is an addition to the <a href="vanarsdel.html"> Van Arsdel Lights </a> app that we built alongside it to serve as the store’s backend management tool, where store employees can manage orders, customers and item stock. Working with stakeholders and art directors I designed a rich experience that can showcase a real world enterprise workflow. Below I’ll walk you through my designs and some of the new features shipped that year.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Density</h3>
   <p class="text">Density was one of the main features talked about at build. Enterprise apps these days have a large amount of information that needs to be displayed all at once for maximum productivity and multitasking. A more dense UI includes elements like text, spacing, and hit targets. My designs were informed with real world enterprise feedback and issues that have been raised by enterprise partners.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Improved table grid</h3>
   <p class="text">A more UX rich table grid was implemented to allowed users functions to filter, sort and rescale the table grid. I made sure the table grid was easily accessible, giving users visual hints and multiple ways they can access all the functions.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">Adaptive command bar</h3>
   <p class="text">An addition to the table grid was I designed a contextual command bar that adapted based on selected items showing related actions and hiding irrelevant ones. I believe UI should not be static, it should adapt and change for a much richer and unique experience.</p>

   <h3 class="heading">My process</h3>
   <p class="text">I strongly believe that there shouldn’t not be a separation between strong UX and stunning visual design, great UX design should always be accompanied by beautiful visual and UI design. With this in mind I spent a great deal of time with sketching, wireframes and prototyping. We had some really longs night incorporating feedback and getting the experience just right. Each meeting we devoted time for in-depth design cretic and deciding if our proposed solutions addressed enterprise software problems and if out designs provided the more efficient way to accomplish tasks.</p>
